ReactJS.NET
===========
ReactJS.NET is a library that makes it easier to use Facebook's
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and
[JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) from C#. To get
started, [take a look at the documentation](http://reactjs.net/getting-started/getting-started.html).

**It is currently under development and there is no stable release at the moment.
Coming soon!**
